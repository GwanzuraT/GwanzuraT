### Hi there 👋
I am a second year PhD candidate in the Epidemiology department at Florida International University.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my dissertation which is titled "Identifying individual and community factors associated with high COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates among people with HIV." 
- I am also working on R package development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: data science techniques using R markdown, python, Quarto, Shinny app, machine learning and GIS.
- 📫 You can reach me at tgwan001@fiu.edu or tngwanzura@gmail.com
- Fun fact: I am a adrenaline seeking, a great celebration constitutes sky diving, bungee jumping or snorkeling with sharks!
